# SimBioProj
Computational biology project


The aim of this project is to generate a genome evolution algorithm without mutation and use [https://github.com/bilalelhoudaigui/TCDS-v2.git] to compute its transcriptional profile. This profile is then used to compute a fitness and, on the basis of a Monte Carlo Metropolis algorithm, tend to an optimal profile for the simulated environment.
